# Personal Consumption Expenditure in the US - The 2020 Case

This project is an exploration of the takeaways featured in the Feb 24 2021 Bloomberg article ['The Cereal Industry Had a Very Weird Year.'](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-24/beyond-grape-nuts-cereal-makers-had-a-very-weird-year)

The main takeaways are:

- Covid might have caused food shortages.
- Cereal production has also been impacted.
- The category 'cereal' does not only include cereal breakfast cereals. Rice, pasta, and flour are also items in this category/sub-category.
- March 2020 was the biggest monthly increase since 1973.
- Higher demand broke the declinig trend in sales. 
- Historically, the American public consumes
- Panic buying could have been a factor, as the spike was general all throught groups, being perishable or non-perishable foods. 
- Breakfast cereals have a fairly long shell life and also pertain to a group with foods like flour, pasta, or rice, which are staples in many households and last long. 
- Alcohol drinks increased during the onset of the pandemic in the US (March 2020) and the implementation of the first control measures. It remained above pre-Covid throughout 2020, likely due to bars and other alcohol-serving establishments being closed or providiing minimum services.
- Moments of crisis in recent American history (9/11 attacks, Iraq and Afghanistan invasions, and the 2008 financial crisis) are interesting milestones to which compare the March 2020 consumer response to Covid against, as changes in GDP derived from oil prices or the the actual lost of financial stability have the potential to affect personal consumption spending.
