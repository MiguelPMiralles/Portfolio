    "COVID has struck the whole world and more than two years since the onset of the pandemic, its effects are still felt, irrespective of community or region. Canada has been no exception. However, efforts have been put by governments and civil socieity to contain the spread of the virus. Mass vaccination and booster roll-outs have decreased the lethality of the virus. \n",

    "In this project, I am going to use the data put forth by the [City of Toronto](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/covid-19-cases-in-toronto/) on COVID cases to produce two types of classifications tasks. In the first one, I will try to use relevant features to discern between the possible outcomes (fatal, resolved, or active) as well as the whether the cases are outbreak-related or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second classification task, I will use information regarding source of infection, neighborhood names nad FSA [Forward Sortation Area](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/br03396.html) to classify whether a case is classified as probable or confirmed. Given the textual, string-based nature of the two aforementioned dimensions, I will use a Multinomial Naive-Bayes text categorizer. This might help in mapping out what areas and postal codes have experienced what type of infection episodes.\n",
