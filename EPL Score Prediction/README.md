# EPL Game Outcome Prediction
This project is based on Dataquest's two-part series tutorial on [web scraping with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt7WJa2iu0s&t=3s) and implementation of [ML algorithms to predict the outcome of English Premier League games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0irmDBWLrco). One of the goals of this project was to learn how to scrape a web site and how to refactor dimensions of interest to implement machine learning algorithms. While I followed the tutorial for the firt task of the project, given that this was my first time scraping that much data, I redimensioned the data for machine learning purporses, making it purely time series.

A dataframe was created with the scraped data, then exported to  CSV file. Later on, a dedicated Jupyter notebook file was created to investigate ways to predict match outcomes (win/ no win) given different metrics and stats. These assets are all stored in the ['Data'](https://github.com/MiguelPMiralles/Portfolio/tree/main/EPL%20Score%20Prediction/Data) folder.
