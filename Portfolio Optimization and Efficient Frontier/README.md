Two notebooks comprise this portofolio. The ['MPT'](https://github.com/MiguelPMiralles/Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio%20Optimization%20and%20Efficient%20Frontier/MPT.ipynb) notebook contains a return, volatlity and Sharpe Ratio analysis of a set of securities for a given portfolio. The goal is to apply the principles of Modern Portfolio Theory approach while running a Monte Carlo simulation to obtain the optimal weights. As a result of it, the combination that maximizes return at the expense of risk was calculated (for that, the Sharpe Ratio was used, as it returns the excess return per unit of volatility), as well as the efficient frontier, the set of combinations that have a good return-to-risk relation.

The other is also an efficient frontier search for a set of ETFs that replicate benchmark indices. The selection is inspired by [Indexa's mix for ETFs](https://indexacapital.com/es/esp/model?product=pension) that track stocks of markets in the US, Europe, Japan, and emerging markets. The main goal was to inspect whether simulated combinations of weighrs could render portfolio weights similar to those devised by Indexa Capital.
