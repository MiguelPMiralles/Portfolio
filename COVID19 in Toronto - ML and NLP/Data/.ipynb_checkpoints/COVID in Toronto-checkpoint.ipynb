    "COVID has struck the whole world and more than two years since the onset of the pandemic, its effects are still felt, irrespective of community or region. Canada has been no exception. However, efforts have been put by governments and civil socieity to contain the spread of the virus. Mass vaccination and booster roll-outs have decreased the lethality of the virus. \n",

    "In this project, I am going to use the data put forth by the [City of Toronto](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/covid-19-cases-in-toronto/) on COVID cases to produce two types of classifications tasks. In the first one, I will try to use relevant features to discern between the possible outcomes (fatal, resolved, or active) as well as the whether the cases are outbreak-related or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second classification task, I will use information regarding source of infection, neighborhood names nad FSA [Forward Sortation Area](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/br03396.html) to classify whether a case is classified as probable or confirmed. Given the textual, string-based nature of the two aforementioned dimensions, I will use a Multinomial Naive-Bayes text categorizer. This might help in mapping out what areas and postal codes have experienced what type of infection episodes.\n",

    "The precision-recall curve, a computation of the precision (the ratio of actual trues divided by the sum of all values identified as true, actual or not) against the recall (the ratio of actual true values divided by the sum of actual true values, regardless of whether they are correctly identified or not) for a classifier given different thresholds. A shape like the one shown below, gives the impression of the classifier being 'perfect', as it has been able to score perfect precision and recall at every threshold. This is far from perfect. With imbalaced datasets, the precision recall curve captures well what's going on with the classification model, as [Soledad Galli demonstrates here.](https://github.com/solegalli/machine-learning-imbalanced-data/blob/master/Section-03-Metrics/03-08-Optional-Comparison-ROC-PRC.ipynb)"
