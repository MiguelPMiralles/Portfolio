# TTC Delays
This project aims at using different time series models to predict and forecast the delay times the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) has incurred over time. 

The data, pulled from both government sites and Kaggle, spans from January 2014 to September 2021. Being incomplete, the goal is to asses whether forecasting methods such as as Holt-Winters exponential smoothing, ARIMA and Facebook's Prophet are useful in determining the behavior of this series, which are calculated on a monthly basis (data is recorded on a daily frequency). At the moment, only Holt-Winters has been implemented.

The assets for the prohect are Jupyter Notebook with a background presentation of the project, basiv visualizations to lay a top view of the series and the forecasting analysis.
